# Yare-RL
Reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train and evaluate bots for [yare.io](yare.io).

# Usage
For now, the Yare environment is not implemented and there there is no RL training happening.
You will also need a few Python libraries, please refer to `requirements.txt`.
To run a random baseline on PettingZoo's butterfly game "knights_archers_zombies_v7":
```
python3 yare-rl/train.py --env butterfly
```
